# Dotfiles

Shoutout to [AreamanM](https://github.com/AreamanM) for the base code for a lot of these dot files (including inputrc and some of bashrc) - check out his [dotfile repository](https://github.com/AreamanM/dots) too!

Also, shoutout to the [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) project for providing me with the base code for my neovim config - check that repo out below! It is a great resource for beginners (like myself) in nvim.
